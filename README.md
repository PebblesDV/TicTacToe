# TicTacToe

This is the first ever thing I have made in VSCode!

It's a simple TicTacToe game made with P5JS

I made a 3x3 grid, where player 1 and player 2 can battle against eachother

Player 1 is the color blue, and player 2 is the color red

With the "Choose player" button, the game will decide which player gets to start the game

With the "Restart game" button, the game will restart and the whole board will reset

On the left side of the board it will show which players turn it is at that moment

Once the game is finished, the cells that are still white can not be clicked anymore

If either of the players win the game will show who won, and if it's a tie the game will show that aswell
